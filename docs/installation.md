    Information for installing `camlhmp` on your system
---

`camlhmp` is available through [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/camlhmp/) and
[Bioconda](https://bioconda.github.io/recipes/camlhmp/README.html). While you can install it
through PyPi, it is recommended to install it through BioConda so that non-Python dependencies
are also installed.

```bash
conda create -n camlhmp -c conda-forge -c bioconda camlhmp
conda activate camlhmp
camlhmp
```

# About

## Naming

I really wanted to name a tool with "camel" in it because they are my wife's favorite animalüê™
and camels also remind me of my friends in Oman!

Once it was decided YAML was going to be the format for defining schemas, I immediately was
drawn into "Classification through YAML", or _CAML_", but quickly found out many others had
also thought of this (_for other use cases_). We went through a few other iterations of
_CAML_ without any success. Fortunately, Tim Read came through with a clutch save suggested
_"Heuristic Mapping Protocol"_. So, here we are - _camlhmp_!

## Funding

Support for this project came (in part) from the [Wyoming Public Health Division](https://health.wyo.gov/publichealth/), and
the [Center for Applied Pathogen Epidemiology and Outbreak Control (CAPE)](https://www.linkedin.com/company/center-for-applied-pathogen-epidemiology-and-outbreak-control/).
